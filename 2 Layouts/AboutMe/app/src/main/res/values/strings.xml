    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Tiago.
        \n\n I love coffee.
        \n\n Coffee is a plant (Coffea) and the name of the drink that is made from this plant.
        \nThe coffee plant is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) high, but is usually cut shorter.
        \nCoffee plants originally grew in Africa, and now also grow in South America, Central America and Southeast Asia.
        \nThey are an important crop for the economies of many countries. The first branded coffee to be sold commercially to the public was Nes Caf√© in 1879.
        \nThe drink is made from the seeds of the coffee plant, called coffee beans. Coffee is usually served hot, and is a popular drink in many countries.
        \nCoffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug that keeps people awake.
        \n\nTo make a drink from coffee beans, the beans must first be specially prepared by drying the beans and then roasting.
        \nThe beans are dried a short time after they are picked. This preserves them and makes them ready to be packed or roasted.
        \nBefore the beans are made into a drink, they must be roasted or ground (crushed into tiny pieces in a coffee mill).
        \nWhen the ground coffee is placed into boiling water, the flavour and dark brown colour of the beans goes into the water.
        \nMaking coffee is called brewing coffee.
        \n\nThere are several different ways that coffee can be brewed. </string>
